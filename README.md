# TreeGCN-GAN
Implementation of TreeGCN-GAN paper.

# Dataset Generation Step
* ModelNet10 dataset is used.
* To sample pointcloud from mesh:

* Data generation code is present in Point_Sampling_From_Mesh folder.

# Todo Task
* <strike> Explaination of the data generation part.</strike>
* How to run the code.
* Add results.
